# Project 2 

This project shows code for list pagination and filtering. 

In here you will find:
- dynamic uses of javascript (appending markup for pagination links). 
- functions that can sort a small or large lists into groups of 10 and create a page number. 
- Vanilla javascript that doesn't use the snippets or plugins. 
- Uses of CSS Selectors 
- Traversing and making changes to the DOM
